During the creation of Assignemnt 1, I was refreshed on server proccessing, javascript, and html. My programming skills definitly improved by helping others complete the assignment. I feel that for now I do not need to improve anything specific moving into assignment 2. I can do all the wods without the screencast, and but the labs definitly helped me learn most.  Definitly feel ready for assignment 2. This class is great and i do not think there is any significant improvements to make it better, maybe get rid of recording WODs. What helped most was probably the Labs.
