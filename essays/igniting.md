In my very first WOD, I was able to finish with a decent time and learned about building websites in HTML. I utilized ChatGPT and worked on my prompt making skills over the course of all of these WODS. The first WOD helped me learn how to incorporate images, hyperlinks to websites, and hyperlinks to positions in the same website. Overall, this first WOD was a good expereince in getting some basic knowledge down. 

In WOD 2, I was able to link to a css file to my created index. I learned how to use this css file as a style sheet and changed the font, spacing, and margins. 

WOD 3 really opened my eyes, as I was able to contain my paragraphs about the web browsers into containers named columns, and then was able to change the atributes of these in my css sheet. This really opened my eyes to how to really use css to change the format of my website and how advanced it can get. In order to create a horizontal navigation bar, I utilized the same skills showing how far these stratiges go in formatting a website. 

Overall, this set of WODS really helped develop my html and css development skills.
