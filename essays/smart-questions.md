This weeks WOD (found here https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/050.variables_data_types/experience-SmartPhoneProducts1_variables.html) was probably the one of the easier WODs this semester so far. It involved creating variables for the names, prices, and links to smart phone images for our webstore. The WOD was completed without any real issues, and nothing really slowed me down. No preperation was done for this WOD, as I thought that my programming background would help me more when we get closer to just javascript, as I am comfortable with the language. I did less prep compared to the WODs before this as I was still getting used to the format/syntax of HTML as a language, but now as I understand more, preperation was not nessesary. I feel like the only thing that could have done better for me this WOD was to make sure I renamed all calls to the variable correctly, as I forgot a number near the end which was quickly fixed.
